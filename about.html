            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>Five very diverse strangers came together for the Microsoft Azure U.S. Hack for Accessibilty hackathon hosted by Devpost and came up with AI Dog.</p>
            <p>AI Dog helps a user find an accessible route from point A to point B on campus. We were inspired to make navigating more accessible after we learned first hand how difficult it is to get around campus with a leg injury.</p>
            <p>We also shared the concept for the web app with colleagues, friends and co-workers who work in assistance programs in higher ed. They shared some input and confirmed how assisting those with a disability navigating a campus could be very useful.</p>
            <h2>How does it Work?</h2>
            <P>AI Dog collects geo location data on campus using the Google Streetview API which we then pass to the Azure Computer Vision API to analyze the returned Google Streetview API images to determine if the location is accessible or not.</P>
            <p>Some things we look for in the analyzed images may be sidewalks, crosswalks, ramps, lack of stairs, etc.</p>
            <p>We store the results of our campus evaluation in an Azure Cosmos database for use in our web app.</p>
            <p>The AI Dog interface is an accessible website where a user can easily find an accessible route to where they need to go on campus.</p>
            <p>By choosing the campus they are on, and entering their current and destination location they will get accessible directions. Upon hitting the submit button a request is made to an Azure Function API we developed to analyze the info stored in our Azure Cosmos database and return an accessible route to the user.</p>
            <h2>Whats Next?</h2>
            <p>Things we’d like to improve upon in future releases of AI Dog would be the inclusion of more college campuses as well as improving the efficiencies of our backend and Azure Function API.</p>
